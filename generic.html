									<h1>About Me</h1>
								</header>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/re-do.png" alt="" /></span></p>
								<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Hi there, and welcome to my data analyst portfolio website! My name is Inari Coleman, and I'm excited to share with you some of the work I've done as a data analytics apprentice at Google and my journey into becoming a Data Analyst. As a data analyst, I'm passionate about using data to solve complex problems and drive sound business decisions.My core competencies include exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling,data visualization,web Analytics which I proficiently execute through various tools such as Python,SQL,Microsoft Excel,Google sheets,Google Data Studio and Tableau.</p>
								<p style="text-indent: 50px;"><span class="image right"><img src="images/Cole .png" alt="Cat parent" /></span> On this website, you will find examples of my work, including my Marketing Strategy for the Google Merchandise Store, my Exploratory Data Analysis projects, and my IMDB web scraping. I am particularly proud of my first project as a Marketing Science apprentice, which involved creating an insight-driven marketing strategy for the Google Merchandise Store. I had complete freedom to choose the focus of my analysis and make recommendations based on my findings. I concentrated on shopper behavior, analyzing which product categories generated the most revenue, the demographics of the most frequent purchasers, and the devices and browsers most commonly used by buyers (Chrome on desktop). Based on my analysis, I recommended YouTube ads for building awareness (top of the funnel), Gmail ads for consideration (middle of the funnel), and search ads for driving action (bottom of the funnel). I also suggested discontinuing the use of coupons, which proved to be ineffective and drove less than 500 transactions. By tailoring my recommendations to the appropriate stage of the marketing funnel, I created a more effective marketing strategy that improved the overall customer journey. You can find my resume, professional experiences, and education listed on my website. When I am not working with data, I enjoy traveling and spending time with my cats. I believe a healthy work-life balance is essential for productivity and motivation. Thank you for visiting my portfolio website! If you have any questions or would like to connect, please feel free to contact me on LinkedIn. I am always eager to engage with fellow data analysts and enthusiasts.</p>
